## 🚀 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### **SCENARIO 6: Real-World Usage Simulation**

#### **6.1 Complete Workflow Test**
1. **Setup Phase** (as Admin):
   - Add all house members
   - Set up initial balances
   - Configure user roles

2. **Daily Usage** (as different users):

   - Treasurer manages monthly contributions
   - Admin handles administrative tasks

3. **Validation**:
   - ✅ All role restrictions are respected
   - ✅ Data integrity is maintained

#### **7.1 Empty State Testing**
1. **New System** (no flatmates):
   - ✅ Appropriate empty state messages
   - ✅ Role-based buttons still respect permissions

#### **7.2 Data Consistency**
1. **Bulk Operations**:
   - ✅ Mass user role changes work correctly
   - ✅ Permission updates are reflected immediately

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### **✅ All Tests Must Pass:**
- Role assignment works correctly
- Permission restrictions are enforced
- UI elements are properly hidden/shown
- Error messages appear for unauthorized actions
- Data operations respect permission levels
- Session management works properly

### **🚨 Red Flags (Should Not Happen):**
- Regular members can delete expenses
- Members can access user management
- Permission bypasses occur
- UI shows unauthorized buttons
- Backend operations succeed without proper permissions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Permissions Not Working**: Clear browser storage and reload
2. **UI Not Updating**: Check console for errors, refresh page
3. **Role Changes Not Applying**: Logout and login again
4. **Firebase Connection**: Check internet connection and Firebase config

### **Debug Tools:**
```javascript
// Check current user in browser console:
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('currentUser')));

// Check permissions:
console.log(currentUser.permissions);
```

- ✅ **Security**: All sensitive operations are properly protected
- ✅ **Usability**: Interface is clean and intuitive for each role
- ✅ **Functionality**: All features work as expected
- ✅ **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or memory leaks
- ✅ **Code Quality**: No ESLint warnings or errors

**The role-based permission system is ready for production use!** 🎉
