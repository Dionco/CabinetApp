## 🧪 TESTING SCENARIOS

### Test Case 1: Basic Toggle Functionality
1. **Setup**: Navigate to Settlement Summary section
2. **Expected**: See flatmates with debt and payment toggle buttons
3. **Action**: Click toggle button for a debtor-creditor relationship
4. **Expected**: Button changes from ❌ Unpaid to ✅ Paid (or vice versa)
5. **Verification**: Status should persist after page refresh

### Test Case 2: Permission System
1. **Setup**: Login as user with EDIT_EXPENSE permission
2. **Expected**: Toggle buttons are visible and functional
3. **Action**: Login as user without EDIT_EXPENSE permission
4. **Expected**: Toggle buttons should not be visible

### Test Case 3: Payment Status Tracking
1. **Setup**: Multiple debtors owing money to multiple creditors
2. **Action**: Mark some payments as paid
3. **Expected**: "Bank Transfer Status" should show:
   - "All Transfers Complete" when all payments are marked paid
   - "Pending Transfer" when some payments are unpaid

### Test Case 4: Data Persistence
1. **Action**: Toggle payment status
2. **Expected**: Data should persist in Firestore 'settlementPayments' collection
3. **Verification**: Check Firestore console for document with structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     debtorName: string,
     creditorName: string,
     amount: number,
     paid: boolean,
     lastUpdated: Date,
     updatedBy: string
   }
   ```

### Test Case 5: Visual Feedback
1. **Expected**: Clear visual distinction between paid/unpaid states
2. **Expected**: Hover effects on toggle buttons
3. **Expected**: Color coding (green for paid, red for unpaid)

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
