## 💰 Adding Expenses

### When You Buy Something for the House

1. Click **"Add New Expense"**
2. **Description**: What did you buy? (e.g., "Weekly groceries", "Toilet paper")
3. **Amount**: How much did it cost? (e.g., €45.67)
4. **Category**: What type of expense?
   - 🍕 Food & Cooking (groceries, takeout)
   - 🧻 Toilet Paper & Toiletries (TP, shampoo, soap)
   - 🧽 Cleaning Products (detergent, sponges)
   - 🍺 Beer & Drinks (alcohol, soft drinks)
   - ⚡ Utilities (gas, water, electricity)
   - 📦 Other (anything else)
5. **Paid By**: Select yourself
6. **Split Between**: Check everyone who should pay for this
7. Click **"Add Expense"**

### Smart Splitting Examples

- **Groceries**: Usually split between everyone who eats
- **Toilet paper**: Split between everyone in the house
- **Beer for party**: Only split between people attending
- **Personal items**: Don't add to shared expenses

## 🏦 Bank Import (Advanced)

### If Your House Uses ING Bank

1. Someone with access to the shared ING account exports transactions
2. Click **"🏦 Import Bank"** button
3. Upload the CSV file from ING
4. The app automatically categorizes expenses and contributions
5. Review and assign any unassigned contributions

### How to Export from ING
1. Log into mijn.ing.nl
2. Select your shared account
3. Go to "Transacties" (Transactions)
4. Click "Download" → Choose CSV format
5. Select last month's transactions

## 📊 Understanding Your Balance

### What the Colors Mean
- **Green balance (+€25.50)**: You are owed money
- **Red balance (-€15.20)**: You owe money
- **Zero balance (€0.00)**: You're all settled up! 🎉

### How Balances Work
- When you **pay for something**: Your balance goes UP
- When **others pay for you**: Your balance goes DOWN
- When you **contribute monthly**: Your balance goes UP

### Example Scenario
1. Alice buys groceries for €60, splits between Alice, Bob, Charlie
   - Alice: +€40 (paid €60, owes €20)
   - Bob: -€20 (owes his share)
   - Charlie: -€20 (owes his share)

## 💳 Monthly Contributions

### How It Works
- Each flatmate contributes €10 per month to the shared pot
- This money covers shared expenses like groceries, cleaning supplies
- Click **"💰 Add Contribution"** when you transfer your monthly amount

### Best Practice
- Transfer exactly €10 to the house account each month
- Use description like "House contribution June 2025"
- The app tracks who has paid and who hasn't

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better Expense Tracking
- **Be specific**: "Albert Heijn groceries" vs "Food"
- **Include everyone**: Don't forget to check all participants
- **Regular updates**: Add expenses when you buy them, not weeks later
- **Keep receipts**: Take photos for backup/verification

### For Smooth Settlements
- **Settle weekly**: Don't let balances build up too much
- **Use bank transfers**: Easier to track than cash
- **Clear descriptions**: "Settlement for house expenses June" 
- **Round up**: €23.47 → pay €25 (creates positive buffer)

### For Avoiding Arguments
- **Transparent process**: Everyone can see all expenses
- **Fair splitting**: Include everyone unless it's truly personal
- **Regular check-ins**: Monthly balance review meeting
- **Emergency fund**: Keep small positive balance for unexpected expenses

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my expense"
- Check if you're on the right tab
- Look in the "Expenses" tab for all expenses
- Use the search function

### "My balance seems wrong"
- Review recent expenses in the Analytics tab
- Check if all your expenses were added correctly
- Ask flatmates if they forgot to add something

### "Bank import isn't working"
- Make sure you're using ING CSV format
- Check that the file actually contains transactions
- Try a smaller date range (one month)

### "I can't add an expense"
