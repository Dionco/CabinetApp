# üéâ Finance App Improvements Summary

## What Was Wrong Before
Your original app had a simple expense tracker that only:
- Tracked total expenses in a single balance
- Didn't handle multiple people
- Couldn't split expenses between flatmates

- No way to see who owes what to whom

## Perfect for Student Houses

Your app now handles all the common student house scenarios:
- **Weekly grocery runs**: Split between whoever eats the food
- **Household supplies**: Everyone chips in for toilet paper, cleaning products
- **Utilities**: Split monthly bills evenly
- **Party supplies**: Only participants pay for beer and snacks
- **Individual purchases**: Track when someone covers others temporarily

## Example Usage Flow

1. **Add flatmates**: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"
2. **Alice buys groceries**: ‚Ç¨60, split between Alice, Bob, Charlie
   - Alice balance: +‚Ç¨40 (paid ‚Ç¨60, owes ‚Ç¨20)
   - Bob & Charlie: -‚Ç¨20 each
3. **Bob buys cleaning supplies**: ‚Ç¨12, split between everyone
   - Bob balance: +‚Ç¨9 (paid ‚Ç¨12, owes ‚Ç¨3)
   - Everyone else: -‚Ç¨3 each
4. **Settlement**: App shows "Charlie owes ‚Ç¨23 to Alice and Bob"

This creates a much more practical and useful tool for managing shared expenses in a student house! üè†‚ú®
