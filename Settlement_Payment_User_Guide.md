# 📖 Settlement Payment Tracking - User Guide

## 🎯 What is Settlement Payment Tracking?

The Settlement Payment Tracking feature helps you keep track of when flatmates have actually transferred settlement money to the shared bank account. This is separate from the calculated debts shown in the app.

### 🔍 How It Works

1. **Calculated Debts** (Red amounts) = Based on shared expenses in the app
2. **Payment Status** (✅/❌ buttons) = Whether money has been transferred to bank account

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users with Payment Permission (Admin/Treasurer)

#### Step 1: Navigate to Settlement Summary
- Scroll down to the "💰 Settlement Summary" section on the main dashboard
- You'll see any outstanding debts between flatmates

#### Step 2: Mark Payments as Complete
- Find the debtor-creditor relationship (e.g., "Alice owes €25.50 to Bob")
- Click the payment status button:
  - ❌ **Unpaid** = Money hasn't been transferred yet
  - ✅ **Paid** = Money has been transferred to bank account

#### Step 3: Track Overall Status
- The "Bank Transfer Status" shows:
  - **"All Transfers Complete"** = All settlement money has been transferred
  - **"Pending Transfer"** = Some payments still need to be transferred

### For Regular Members

- You can **view** payment status but cannot change it
- This helps everyone see when settlements have been completed
- Only users with expense permissions can mark payments as paid

## 📱 Visual Guide

### Payment Status Buttons
- **❌ Unpaid** (Red) = Click to mark as paid
- **✅ Paid** (Green) = Click to mark as unpaid

### Status Indicators
- **Individual Status**: Each payment relationship has its own status
- **Overall Status**: Shows whether all transfers for a person are complete

## 🔐 Permissions

### Who Can Mark Payments?
- **Admin**: Full access to all payment toggles
- **Treasurer**: Can mark all payments as paid/unpaid
- **Moderator**: Can manage settlement payments
- **Member**: View-only access

### Security Features

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Treasurers
1. **Regular Updates**: Mark payments as paid when bank transfers are confirmed
2. **Double Check**: Verify actual bank account balance before marking as paid
3. **Communication**: Let flatmates know when you've updated payment status

### For All Users
1. **Check Status Regularly**: Keep an eye on payment status to know settlement progress
2. **Ask Questions**: If payment status seems incorrect, ask the treasurer
3. **Be Patient**: Status updates happen when bank transfers are confirmed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I can't see the toggle buttons"
- **Solution**: You need expense management permissions. Contact your admin.

#### "Payment status isn't updating"
- **Solution**: Refresh the page or check your internet connection.

#### "I accidentally marked a payment wrong"
- **Solution**: Click the button again to toggle back to the correct status.

- Bob doesn't know if Alice has transferred the money
- Confusion and follow-up messages needed

### After Settlement Payment Tracking
- Alice owes Bob €25.50 (calculated debt - stays the same)
- Payment status: ❌ Unpaid (Alice hasn't transferred yet)
- Alice transfers money to bank account
- Treasurer marks payment as ✅ Paid
- Bob can see payment is complete, Alice's debt calculation remains for reference
